# p5.js for iOS
Hey there! This repository is the main code for my p5.js ios app. Feel free to list any issues or contribute. There is room for a lot of improvement. If you find a bug please only file an issue. I will add it to the list below if nessecary.

I noticed there are quite some people that prefer an iPad over a laptop because of its mobility and I find myself wanting to just quickly code some idea on my iPhone as well. Sadly there wasn't a good native p5.js (or even javascript) app available and the online p5 editor on p5js.org doesn't really work that well on mobile devices.

I don't know if anyone will ever bother looking at this code, but please keep in mind I am not a proffesional app creator and I therefore don't really know how things are 'suppost' to be done but rather I know how to do things in a way that they'll work.
