# Read me
I don't know if anyone will ever bother looking at this code, but please keep in mind I am not a proffesional app creator and I therefore don't really know how things are 'suppost' to be done but rather I know how to do things in a way that they'll work.

Feel free to list any issues or contribute. There is room for a lot of improvement.
If you find a bug please only file an issue. I will add it to the list below if nessecary.
